# spaceInvaders

Pseudo code:

Main goals:
1. Create a canvas and a black background.

2. Create a ship at the bottom of the screen.

3. Allow that ship to move to the left or right when the user clicks on the approprate keyboard button.

4. When the user clicks on the space bar, allow for a projectile to shoot from the ship upward.

5. Create an enemy that can be destroyed when the projectile hits it.

6. Display a win screen if enemy has been destroyed.

3. Create a way to reset the board
4. Track the users score
  - Number of hits
  - Number of ships remaining
5. Randomize enemy speed.
